<h1>Installing MASTIF (MITRE Internal Instructions)<br>
</h1>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Download
the UIMA 2.3.1 zip file or tar ball (from&nbsp;<a href="http://uima.apache.org/downloads.cgi">http://uima.apache.org/downloads.cgi</a>).
&nbsp;Extract this to a location on your machine, preferably one
without spaces in the path. &nbsp;I usually extract the archive, which
produces a folder "apache-uima" and then move this to /opt/uima (linux
and mac) or c:\opt\uima (pc).<br>
    <br>
For windows:<br>
mkdir c:\temp\extract<br>
mkdir c:\opt<br>
(unzip the downloaded zip file to c:\temp\extract)<br>
move c:\temp\extract\apache-uima c:\opt\uima<br>
    <br>
For mac/linux:<br>
mkdir /opt /tmp/extract<br>
tar -xvzf /path/to/uimaj.tar.gz<br>
mv /opt/tmp/extract/apache-uima /opt/uima<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In
your environment, set UIMA_HOME to be the directory where you installed
UIMA.</li>
  <li>Also modifying your environment, add the bin directory below the
UIMA installation directory ("c:\opt\uima\bin" on windows or
"/opt/uima/bin" on mac/linux) to your PATH environment variable. <br>
    <br>
On windows your new PATH variable should look like:<br>
    <br>
c:\opt\uima\bin;<span class="inlineReplacement">(YOUR OLD PATH)</span><br>
    <br>
On linux/mac, your new PATH variable should look like:<br>
    <br>
/opt/uima/bin:<span class="inlineReplacement">(YOU OLD PATH)</span><br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Create
a directory on your system to host the installed pear files, the input
files directory, and the output files directory. &nbsp;For me, I did
this under /mastif (on a mac or linux box â€” on windows this would be
c:\mastif)<br>
    <br>
My directory structure looks like:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>/mastif</li>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>installed_pears</li>
      <li>input</li>
      <li>output</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Grab
the file "<a href="http://employeeshare.mitre.org/m/mcoarr/transfer/medfact/ctakes_and_assertion/MITRE-ASSERTION-CTAKES-PIPELINE-2011-12-28.zip">MITRE-ASSERTION-CTAKES-PIPELINE-2011-12-28.zip</a>"
from my transfer folder. &nbsp;Extract this to a temporary location on
your sytem. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Run
$UIMA_HOME/bin/runPearInstaller.sh (linux/mac) or
%UIMA_HOME%\bin\runPearInstaller.bat (win)</li>
  <li>Set
the installation directory to be the "installed_pears" directory you
created in step 3 above.</li>
  <li>For each of the following
(in order) choose the pear file (inside the "pear-files" directory that
was created when you extracted the zip file above), click install, and
make sure it installs successfully (screen text will be blue on success
and
red on error):
    <div>
    <ul class="compactList" type="circle">
      <li>core</li>
      <li>document preprocessor</li>
      <li>POS tagger</li>
      <li>chunker</li>
      <li>context dependent
tokenizer</li>
      <li>dictionary lookup DB</li>
      <li>LVG</li>
      <li>NE contexts</li>
      <li>assertion</li>
      <li>clinical
documents pipeline</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>To test successful
install, run "cvd.sh" (mac/linux) or "cvd.bat" (windows) on the
commandline to start up the CAS visual debugger.</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Choose Run -&gt; Load
AE. &nbsp;Then browse to your installed pear files directory, then open
"clinical documents pipeline/clinical documents pipeline_pear.xml" and
say ok. &nbsp;It'll take a few (5-10) seconds to load. &nbsp;Make sure
this loads correctly.&nbsp; If there's a problem, you'll get an error
dialog and perhaps
error message in the console window where you started this.&nbsp; If it
loads successfully, you'll see a message in the status bar at the
bottom of the window saying "Done loading AE
AggregatePlainTextProcessor in <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
seconds".<br>
    </li>
    <li>Open a sample text
input document (You can use any clinical document.&nbsp; If you have
access to the i2b2 data, I'd suggest the i2b2 eval data set 0001.txt,
but you
can use something else). &nbsp;Do this by going to File -&gt; Open Text
File.</li>
    <li>Run
the AE on the text file you just loaded by going to Run -&gt; (second
option) "Run AggregatePlaintextProcessor". &nbsp;This will take a
minute or so to complete. &nbsp;When it completes, there will be a tree
of annotations in the top left pane ("CAS Index Repository").
&nbsp;Expand this and you should see Annotation Index -&gt;
uima.tcas.Annotation -&gt; org.mitre.medfacts.types.Assertion, and a
count of that annotation will be in brackets. &nbsp;Click on that and
you'll see the list of annotations in the bottom left pane.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>To
run this over a batch of data, you want to use the CPE (collection
processing engine). &nbsp;Do this by:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Save
one of the sample cpe xml configuration files (see attached) to a
location on your system as cpe.xml. &nbsp;If you use another filename,
update the commands below. &nbsp;For directories, I'd recommend the
directories that you created above -- "/mastif" (linux/mac) or
"c:\mastif" (windows).</li>
    <li>Edit this file to make
the following changes:</li>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>"import" statements
pointing to UIMA components' xml configuration files</li>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Search for lines
that start with "&lt;import". &nbsp;There are 3 in this file that are
not commented out. &nbsp;The first and the third need to be updated to
point to your UIMA installation. &nbsp;The second needs to point to
your "installed_pears" directory.</li>
        <li>The paths in the
"import" elements should be "file:" urls. &nbsp;For mac/linux that
would look like "file:/some/directory/file.txt"; for windows that would
look like "file:/C:/some/directory/file.txt".</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Input and output
directories</li>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Search for
"InputDirectory" and "OutputDirectory". &nbsp;A few lines down from
each of these is a directory that should contain your input text files
and (eventually) will contain your output xmi files. &nbsp;These are
the directories you created beside the "installed_pears" directory.</li>
        <li>The
input and output directories should be file paths, preferably absolute,
though relative paths work too. &nbsp;For windows systems, forward or
backslashes will work. &nbsp;For unix and mac systems, this must be a
forward slash. &nbsp;Also note that this is a file path, not a "file:"
url.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Place
some files in the input directory.</li>
    <li>Back
on the command-line, go to the directory where you saved this cpe.xml
file. &nbsp;Now run "runCPE.sh cpe.xml" (mac/linux) or "runCPE.bat
cpe.xml" (windows). &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
If you're on a mac or linux box, I recommend capturing the output like
using the following command, as this will capture std out and std err
to file and still show it on the screen:<br>
      <br>
runCPE.sh cpe_mimic.xml 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee running_cpe.log</li>
    <li>After
this completes, your output directory will contain an XMI file for each
text input file. &nbsp;This will contain an xml representation of the
CAS, including the assertion annotations. &nbsp;You can look at these
by hand, or run annotationViewer.sh to open these up.</li>
    <li>If
you're viewing the text file by hand, you can search for ":Concept "
and ":Assertion " to find the generated annotations. &nbsp;The concepts
are used internally to map named entity, ontology concept, and rxnorm
concepts to an "i2b2-like" concept annotation used by our assertion
engine. &nbsp;The assertion annotations are the real output of the
MASTIF system. &nbsp;For every "Concept" annotations with a concept
type of "PROBLEM", one Assertion will be generated.<br>
      <br>
If
you don't see this output, either no appropriate concepts were found
to markup or there was a problem, and you should look at the log output
and get in touch with us.&nbsp; For the log output, you should look at
both the console where you executed runCPE and the file uima.log in
your home directory ($HOME on linux/mac; %USERPROFILE% on windows)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The end! &nbsp;Let me
know if you need any help.</li>
