<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Before you get started with MASTIF, you will need to have cTAKES
1.1.2 and UIMA 2.3.1 installed and running.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
These instructions assume that you have UIMA installed (we'll use the
mac/linux path "/opt/uima" and the windows path "c:\opt\uima" in these
examples.&nbsp; Additionally, the bin directory below uima should be in
your system path (that's "/opt/uima/bin" (mac/linux) or
"c:\opt\uima\bin" (windows)].&nbsp; And for cTAKES, we'll assume they
are installed in /opt/ctakes/installed_pears (mac/linux) or
"c:\opt\ctakes\installed_pears" (windows).<br>
  </li>
  <li>In
your environment, set UIMA_HOME to be the directory where you installed
UIMA.</li>
  <li>Also modifying your environment, add the bin directory below the
UIMA installation directory ("c:\opt\uima\bin" on windows or
"/opt/uima/bin" on mac/linux) to your PATH environment variable. <br>
    <br>
On windows your new PATH variable should look like:<br>
    <br>
c:\opt\uima\bin;<span class="inlineReplacement">(YOUR OLD PATH)</span><br>
    <br>
On linux/mac, your new PATH variable should look like:<br>
    <br>
/opt/uima/bin:<span class="inlineReplacement">(YOU OLD PATH)</span><br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Create
a directory on your system to host the input
files directory and the output files directory. &nbsp;For me, I did
this under /mastif (on a mac or linux box — on windows this would be
c:\mastif)<br>
    <br>
My directory structure looks like:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>/mastif</li>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>input</li>
      <li>output</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Grab
the file MASTIF.zip
from the distribution location (ADD LINK HERE).&nbsp; Extract this and
find the file assertion-pear-1.1.pear.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Run
$UIMA_HOME/bin/runPearInstaller.sh (linux/mac) or
%UIMA_HOME%\bin\runPearInstaller.bat (win)</li>
  <li>Set
the installation directory to be the "installed_pears" directory you
used when you setup cTAKES. In our example, that would be
/opt/ctakes/installed_pears (mac/linux) or
c:\opt\ctakes\installed_pears (windows).<br>
    <br>
(We will only be installing the MASTIF assertion module, you must have
ctakes up and running already.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Install the file assertion.pear.&nbsp; Within the pear installer,
choose the pear file that you just extracted, click install, and
make sure it installs successfully (screen text will be blue on success
and
red on error).</li>
  <li>Next, we need to update the clinical documents pipeline to
include the assertion module.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Change directories to the cTAKES installed_pears directory<br>
(mac/linux) cd /opt/ctakes/installed_pears<br>
(windows) cd c:\opt\ctakes\installed_pears</li>
    <li>edit AggregatePlaintextProcessor.xml to add the assertion module<br>
(mac/linux) vi 'clinical documents
pipeline/desc/analysis_engine/AggregatePlaintextProcessor.xml'<br>
(windows) notepad "installed_pears\clinical documents
pipeline\desc\analysis_engine\AggregatePlaintextProcessor.xml"</li>
    <li>Find the closing tag for the delegateAnalysisEngineSpecifiers
(search for "&lt;/delegateAnalysisEngineSpecifiers&gt;").&nbsp; Insert
the following before this line:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;delegateAnalysisEngine
key="AssertionAnnotator"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;import
location="../../../assertion-pear/assertion-pear_pear.xml"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/delegateAnalysisEngine&gt;<br>
    </li>
    <li>Next find the closing fixedFlow tag (search for
"&lt;/fixedFlow&gt;") and add the following line before that:<br>
      <br>
&lt;node&gt;AssertionAnnotator&lt;/node&gt;<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>To test successful
install, run "cvd.sh" (mac/linux) or "cvd.bat" (windows) on the
commandline to start up the CAS visual debugger.</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Choose Run -&gt; Load
AE. &nbsp;Then browse to your installed pear files directory, then open
"clinical documents pipeline/clinical documents pipeline_pear.xml" and
say ok. &nbsp;It'll take a few (5-10) seconds to load. &nbsp;Make sure
this loads correctly.&nbsp; If there's a problem, you'll get an error
dialog and perhaps
error message in the console window where you started this.&nbsp; If it
loads successfully, you'll see a message in the status bar at the
bottom of the window saying "Done loading AE
AggregatePlainTextProcessor in <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
seconds".<br>
    </li>
    <li>Open a sample text
input document (You can use any clinical document.&nbsp; If you have
access to the i2b2 data, I'd suggest the i2b2 eval data set 0001.txt,
but you
can use something else). &nbsp;Do this by going to File -&gt; Open Text
File.</li>
    <li>Run
the AE on the text file you just loaded by going to Run -&gt; (second
option) "Run AggregatePlaintextProcessor". &nbsp;This will take a
minute or so to complete. &nbsp;When it completes, there will be a tree
of annotations in the top left pane ("CAS Index Repository").
&nbsp;Expand this and you should see Annotation Index -&gt;
uima.tcas.Annotation -&gt; org.mitre.medfacts.types.Assertion, and a
count of that annotation will be in brackets. &nbsp;Click on that and
you'll see the list of annotations in the bottom left pane.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>To
run this over a batch of data, you want to use the CPE (collection
processing engine). &nbsp;Do this by:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Save
one of the sample cpe xml configuration files (see attached) to a
location on your system as cpe.xml. &nbsp;If you use another filename,
update the commands below. &nbsp;For directories, I'd recommend the
directories that you created above -- "/mastif" (linux/mac) or
"c:\mastif" (windows).</li>
    <li>Edit this file to make
the following changes:</li>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>"import" statements
pointing to UIMA components' xml configuration files</li>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Search for lines
that start with "&lt;import". &nbsp;There are 3 in this file that are
not commented out. &nbsp;The first and the third need to be updated to
point to your UIMA installation. &nbsp;The second needs to point to
your "installed_pears" directory.</li>
        <li>The paths in the
"import" elements should be "file:" urls. &nbsp;For mac/linux that
would look like "file:/some/directory/file.txt"; for windows that would
look like "file:/C:/some/directory/file.txt".</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Input and output
directories</li>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Search for
"InputDirectory" and "OutputDirectory". &nbsp;A few lines down from
each of these is a directory that should contain your input text files
and (eventually) will contain your output xmi files. &nbsp;These are
the directories you created beside the "installed_pears" directory.</li>
        <li>The
input and output directories should be file paths, preferably absolute,
though relative paths work too. &nbsp;For windows systems, forward or
backslashes will work. &nbsp;For unix and mac systems, this must be a
forward slash. &nbsp;Also note that this is a file path, not a "file:"
url.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Place
some files in the input directory.</li>
    <li>Back
on the command-line, go to the directory where you saved this cpe.xml
file. &nbsp;Now run "runCPE.sh cpe.xml" (mac/linux) or "runCPE.bat
cpe.xml" (windows). &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
If you're on a mac or linux box, I recommend capturing the output like
using the following command, as this will capture std out and std err
to file and still show it on the screen:<br>
      <br>
runCPE.sh cpe_mimic.xml 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee running_cpe.log</li>
    <li>After
this completes, your output directory will contain an XMI file for each
text input file. &nbsp;This will contain an xml representation of the
CAS, including the assertion annotations. &nbsp;You can look at these
by hand, or run annotationViewer.sh to open these up.</li>
    <li>If
you're viewing the text file by hand, you can search for ":Concept "
and ":Assertion " to find the generated annotations. &nbsp;The concepts
are used internally to map named entity, ontology concept, and rxnorm
concepts to an "i2b2-like" concept annotation used by our assertion
engine. &nbsp;The assertion annotations are the real output of the
MASTIF system. &nbsp;For every "Concept" annotations with a concept
type of "PROBLEM", one Assertion will be generated.<br>
      <br>
If you don't see this output, either no appropriate concepts were found
to markup or there was a problem, and you should look at the log output
and get in touch with us.&nbsp; For the log output, you should look at
both the console where you executed runCPE and the file uima.log in
your home directory ($HOME on linux/mac; %USERPROFILE% on windows)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The end! &nbsp;Let me
know if you need any help.&nbsp; Matt Coarr, mcoarr@mitre.org,
