<section ID='24' type='HOSPITAL COURSE'>
<title>HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :</title>
<text> Problem number 1 , multiple myeloma . The patient was re-staged during his admission with a urine and serum electroimmunophoresis and a full skeletal survey . He also received a four-day Decadron burst . The patient had pain in the L3 distribution . His MRI of the spine showed no clear reason for the pain and thus , a pelvic CT was obtained showing a large right pelvic mass that likely was causing his leg pain . Radiation oncology was scheduled for next Tuesday to irradiate the mass . Urinary retention . Although there was a T5 compression fracture compressing the cord without signal change , there was no evidence that this lesion could be causing his urinary retention ; and it was felt that the pelvic mass more likely accounted for his urinary retention . Fevers . His blood and urine cultures were obtained and remained negative throughout admission . His chest X-ray did not reveal source of his fevers . The patient was placed on Levaquin . Shortness of breath . The patient had a V-Q scan on admission that was low probability for PE . The patient had no evidence of acute pulmonary embolus and his shortness of breath resolved over the course of his admission . The patient had a T5 compression fracture with cord deformity . Neurosurgery was consulted . No steroids were recommended . A brace was ordered to stabilize the spine when the patient was up more than 10 minutes . Surgical intervention per Dr. Jescneighagne was being evaluated and considered for the compression following his radiation therapy . Posterior fossa mass . This mass was found on a screening MRI of the head per neurosurgery . Radiation oncology also plans radiation to that lesion while he is getting radiation for the pelvic mass . The patient had no evidence of cerebellar dysfunction on discharge . </text>
